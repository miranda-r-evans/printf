The first version of this project was co-written with Adekunle, but I rewote a new version from scratch at a later time. 
It is compliant with [the betty style guide](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/wiki).

_printf is a clone of printf, with some added features.

conversion specifiers and flags from printf:
* c
* s
* i
* d
* u
* x
* X
* o
* p
* #
* +
* [space]
* l
* h

custom conversion specifiers:
* b (binary)
* S (non-printing chars in a string are printed as ascii value)
* r (prints string in reverse)
* R (prints rot13 encrypted version of string)
